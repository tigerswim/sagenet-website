# SageNet Website Redesign - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Vision**: Position SageNet as THE unified infrastructure expert that multi-site retailers can count on to scale both their connectivity and digital experience needs, while creating natural bridges between IT and Marketing stakeholders who don't traditionally collaborate.

**Core Problem**: SageNet offers best-in-class network services and digital signage solutions, but suffers from critical market positioning challenges:
- **Zero Brand Awareness**: "No one knows who SageNet is" in a market dominated by telecom giants (AT&T, Sprint) and hardware vendors (Samsung)
- **Unique Market Position Underutilized**: SageNet is the only provider offering both network services AND digital signage expertise - a significant competitive advantage that's not being leveraged
- **Disconnected Buyer Journeys**: IT teams buy connectivity/managed services while Marketing teams buy digital signage, but they don't collaborate despite IT being the gatekeeper for Marketing's success
- **Failed Bundle Attempts**: Previous bundling efforts failed because the two buyer groups don't naturally work together
- **Lack of Self-Service Tools**: No ROI calculators, cost comparisons, or evaluation frameworks to help buyers justify decisions

**Solution**: A revolutionary dual-persona website that serves each audience's distinct needs while creating strategic "collaboration catalysts" - touchpoints that help each group discover the mutual benefits of working together. The site will position SageNet as the expert that scales with growing retailers (50-5000+ locations) through personalized support and unmatched flexibility.

## Key Insights from MVP Mockup Development

### **Customer Logo Authority Building**
The mockup development revealed the critical importance of premium brand showcase for immediate credibility. The animated customer logo carousel featuring recognizable brands (T-Mobile, Arby's, Dollar General, etc.) creates instant authority that addresses the core problem of "no one knows who SageNet is." This visual proof of enterprise-level client relationships must be prominently featured in both hero and dedicated sections.

### **Dual-Persona Navigation Excellence**
The mockup validated the effectiveness of clear role-based entry points that adapt content dynamically. The "I Drive Sales & Marketing" vs. "I Manage IT & Operations" button approach provides immediate persona identification while maintaining sophisticated cross-pollination opportunities. This pattern should be implemented with robust analytics to track persona behavior and content consumption patterns.

### **Collaboration Catalyst Validation**
The "Why Both Teams Choose SageNet" section in the mockup demonstrates how to create natural bridges between personas without forcing integration. Content like "IT Checklist for Digital Signage" and "How Infrastructure Drives Marketing ROI" provides value to each persona while educating them about the other group's needs. This approach respects organizational silos while creating opportunities for collaboration.

### **Interactive Engagement Requirements**
The functional ROI calculators in the mockup prove the necessity of self-service tools for enterprise buyers who prefer to educate themselves before engaging sales. The calculators must provide immediate value and credible estimates while capturing qualification data. Animation and interactivity significantly improve engagement and perceived sophistication.

### **Mobile-First Enterprise Experience**
The responsive mockup highlighted that enterprise buyers increasingly research on mobile devices. The design must maintain professional credibility and full functionality across all screen sizes, with particular attention to calculator usability and logo showcase presentation on mobile.

---

This PRD serves as the strategic foundation for transforming SageNet's website into a competitive advantage that not only serves each buyer persona effectively but creates the collaboration bridges necessary to unlock larger, more strategic deals in the multi-site retail market. The mockup development has validated these core concepts and provided a clear visual reference for the implementation team.
